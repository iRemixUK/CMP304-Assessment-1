# Artificial Intelligence
For this project I was tasked with creating two different non-learning AI systems and compare them against each other. 
The two systems I chose were a rule-based system and a behaviour tree. 
I created an application where the AI patrols an area within the game world, if a player is nearby and the AI spots them they will chase them and if they are close enough the AI will attack the player. 
These AI systems were created using C++ within Unreal Engine 5.
